<h1>Simple Home Network</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>

In this activity, i have build a simple network in Packet Tracer in the Logical Workspace.

Part 1: Build a Simple Network

Part 2: Configured the End Devices and Verified Connectivity

In Cisco Packet Tracer, a simple network is built by connecting a PC and a laptop to a wireless router, which is linked to a cable modem and the internet cloud. The PC connects via Ethernet, while the laptop connects wirelessly after replacing its NIC with a wireless module. Both devices get IP addresses via DHCP from the router. Connectivity is verified by pinging cisco.srv, ensuring successful communication within the network and to the internet.
